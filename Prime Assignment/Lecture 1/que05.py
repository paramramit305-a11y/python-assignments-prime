# Evaluate and print the result of the following expression:
# x = 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2

# Based on what you learned in the lecture, explain why the output is what it is.

x = 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2
print(x)


# Expression 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2 me Python operator precedence apply karta hai.

#  Pehle 2 ** 2 evaluate hota hai (power) → 4

# Fir 3 * 4 (multiplication) → 12

# Last me 10 + 12 (addition) → 22


# Isliye final answer 22 aata hai.
